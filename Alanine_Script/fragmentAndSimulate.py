'''
This code extracts the concentrations of isotopologues of interest from the dictionary of all isotopologues   
in order to predict the outcomes of meaurements. It also allows one to fragment the isotopologues to compute the     
outcome of fragment measurements.                                                                                                            

It assumes one has access to a dictionary with information about the isotopologues. See calcIsotopologues.py.

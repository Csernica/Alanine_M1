If the solution is underconstrained, it will also attempt to discover which specific isotopologues are not solved for and output this information to the user. 
    
    Inputs:
        standardData:  A dictionary; keys are mass selections ("M1", "M2") then fragment Keys ("full", "44"), then information about substitutions, observed abundances, predicted abundances, and errors. 
        sampleData: A dictionary; keys are mass selections ("M1", "M2") then fragment Keys ("full", "44"), then information about substitutions, observed abundances, and errors. 
        OCorrection: A dictionary, giving a M+N Relative abundance correction factor and associated error for each fragment of each mass selection. 
        isotopologuesDict: A dictionary; keys are mass selections, values are dataframes giving all of the isotopologues within that mass selection, including information about their fragmentation. 
        fragmentationDictionary: A dictionary, e.g. {'full': {'01': {'subgeometry': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'relCont': 1}},

        N: The number of Monte Carlo simulations to perform.
        GJ: A boolean; True will use the Gauss-Jordan algorithm rather than the numpy solver. 
        debugMatrix: A boolean; True (if GJ is also True) will return every step of the Gauss-Jordan solution, helping the user debug issues. 
        includeSubs: A list of isotopes, if we want to include only certain isotopes in the matrix. If it is nonempty, only isotopes in the list will be included in the matrix. Generally should be empty.

        theory: A boolean, determines whether to calculate fractionation factors from the forward model. Should generally be set to True. 
        perturbTheoryOAmt: A float. For each run of the Monte Carlo, the prtvrnt sbundance correction factors can be perturbed; this may be useful because the factors are only known approximately, so this well better estimate error. 0.001 and 0.002 have been useful values before, but it may depend on the system of interest.
        experimentalOCorrectList: A list, containing information about which peaks to use experimental, rather than theoretical, M+N Relative abundance corrections.
